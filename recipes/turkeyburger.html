        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I love to cook and I'm always trying out new recipes on my family. This was an easy and scrumptious new meal idea! My family loved it. Serve on buns with lettuce, tomatoes, and condiments.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>1 packet dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill for high heat.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, soup mix, and water. Season with salt and pepper. Mix lightly using your hands, and form into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill patties 5 to 10 minutes per side, until well done.</li>
            <li>Serve on buns and condiments and enjoy!</li>
